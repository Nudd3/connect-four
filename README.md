# connect-four

This a project from The Odin Project's Full Stack Ruby on Rails curriculum.

The main thing about this project is that it should be created in a Test-Driven Development way. Recently learning about testing Ruby code using RSpec, this is a project to improve coding ability, but mainly to learn about testing. 

This project is just to create the classic game connect-four. Where two players take turns on placing some kind of symbol on a board. The first person to get four in a row of their symbol wins. 

A player can get four in a row horizontally, vertically and diagonally.
